    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "Model 1 - **Ensemble methods - AdaBoostClassifier**\n",
    "- **Description**\n",
    " - In general, the goal of ensemble methods is to combine the predictions of several \"base estimators\" of a given learning algorithm in order to improve the generalizability and robustness over a single estimator. There are two classes of ensemble methods - Averaging, and Boosting. The difference between the two classes are in the order in which the estimators are applied. Averaging ensemble algorithms are built independently of each other and their results are averaged together to produce the final output. On average, the combined estimator is usualy better than any of the single base estimators because the variance is reduced. By constrast, boosting algoirthms connect the base estimators sequentially and one tries to reduce the bias of the combined estimator. The motivation is to combine several weak methods to create a powerful ensemble.\n",
    " - AdaBoostClassfier is a boosting algorithm. The core principle is to fit a sequence of weak learners (models that are only slightly better than random guessing) on repeatedly modifed versions of the data. The predictions from all of them are then combined through a weighted majority vote to produce the final prediction. The data modifications at each iteration consist of applying weights to each of the training smaples such that the incorrectly classified examples have their weights incrased. In this way, each subseuqent learner concentrates on the examples that have been missed previously. \n",
    "- **Application** \n",
    " - AdaBoost used in basketball player (face / body part) detection ['technical paper'](https://www.uni-obuda.hu/journal/Markoski_Ivankovic_Ratgeber_Pecev_Glusac_57.pdf)\n",
    "- **Strength** \n",
    " - Very resistant to overfitting\n",
    "- **Weakness**\n",
    " - Outliers could force the ensemble down the rabbit hole of working very hard to correct for cases that are rare or unrealistic. It could be wise to remove these outliers from the training set\n",
    "- **Why is it well suited for this dataset?**\n",
    " -  The default base estimator for the AdaBoostClassifier is DecisionTreeClassifier. Decision trees require little data preparation and work well with both numerical and categorical data. So decision trees seem a good fit for our data set. Also, ensemble methods are a powerful tool to enhance predictive power across many different types of datasets because of their ability to combine many leaners into a single consensus. \n",
    "\n",
    "Model 2 - **Ensemble methods - RandomForestClassifier**\n",
    "- **Description**\n",
    " - In contrast to AdaBoostClassifier, the RandomForestClassifier falls under the Averaging class of ensemble methods. Random forests are based on randomized decision trees. Each tree in the ensemble is built from a sample drawn (with replacement) from the training set. In addition, when splitting a node, the split that is chosen is the best split amond a random subset of features. As a result fo theis randomness, the bias usually increases, but, due to averaging, the variance decreases and more than compensates for the bias increase. \n",
    "- **Application** \n",
    " - Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy images to detect issues and prevent blindness ['Journal'](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098587)\n",
    "- **Strength** \n",
    " - Low variance and relatively low bias \n",
    "- **Weakness**\n",
    " - Many parameters to tune when trying to optimize the model. The RandomForestClassifier in sklearn has 16 optional parameters\n",
    "- **Why is it well suited for this dataset?**\n",
    " - As with AdaBoostClassifier, the use of decision trees also makes since with our data, because the number of features relative to examples is low. Ensemble methods also prove to be a powerful method of improving predictive power. \n",
    "\n",
    "Model 3 - **Logistic Regression**\n",
    "- **Description**\n",
    " - A linear model for classification where the probabilities describing possible outcomes of a single example are modeled using the logistic function. \n",
    "- **Application** \n",
    " - Logistic Regression has been applied to a wide variety of problems including: prectiing whether a patient has agiven disease based on observeed characteristics of the patient. Predicting whether an American voter will vote Dem or Rep based on age, income, sex, race, state of residence, etc. Engineering predicitons for predicting the probability of failure for a given system or product\n",
    "- **Strength** \n",
    " - Low variance and less prone to overfitting than decision trees. \n",
    "- **Weakness**\n",
    " - Assumes that there is one smooth continous decision boundary. This may or may not be true of the data. \n",
    "- **Why is it well suited for this dataset?**\n",
    " - As mentioned in \"Applications\", there are good historical results of applying this algorithm to datasets with similar features. \n",

The training and predicting time of the model is not the fastest among the algorithms, but performs quickly nonetheless. Even if predicting millions of examples, the prediction time is very reasonable, no more than a couple of minutes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy and f-score on the training set are very impressive, much higher than the other two models. Accuracy and F-score dropped considerably on the testing set, indicating that this algorithm was overfitting the data. I suspect that tuning the hyperparameters of the RandomForestClassifier, including the number of estimators (n_estimators), max_depth (of each tree), and min_sample_split will help generalize the algorithm and alleviate the overfitting. The base estimator for the RandomForestClassifier is DecisionTreeClassifier. Decision trees are especially well suited for this dataset because they require little data preparation, and easily handle numerical and categorical data. On top of that, the ensemble aspect of RandomForest means that variance can be significantly reduced and overfitting can be controlled. "

    "\n",
    "The RandomForestClassifier is an algorithm that combines predictions from many decision trees. Before explaining the Random Forest, I'd like to back up and explain a decision tree. As the name suggests, decision trees are trees for which each node in the tree asks a question about one of the features of the dataset. A tree is essentially a set of if-then-else rules. The \"decision\", or result, of a question (could be yes/no or one of many possible answers), determines which question is asked next. Asking more questions means the tree grows deeper and the tree can account for more complex decision rules. When you reach a \"leaf\" node (a node without any children), you will have classified the example. There are two main drawbacks to decision trees. Typically, they are prone to overfitting the data. This means the questions asked by the tree are too specific to the training data, and the testing data doesn't get classified as well as the training data. The second drawback is that the creation of the tree - the process of figuring our which questions to ask - can be unstable. A small variation in the training data can result in the creation of a completely different tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to correct for these issues, the RandomForestClassifier combines several weak (smaller) decision trees into an \"ensemble\". Each tree in the ensemble is built by drawing from a random sample from the training set and by focusing on a random subset of our data's features. When averaging over these smaller trees, the predictive power of the ensemble outperforms a single large decision tree.\n",

    "\n",
    "This result was extremely surprising to me. \"marital-status_Married-civ-spouse\" came back as the heaviest weighted feature given the RandomForestClassfier model optimizations generated in the previous step. Intuitively, marital status seems a poor predictor of income level, especially the more narrow 'marital-status_Married-civ-spouse\" feature. However, I could speculate why this feature may play an important role. Perhaps married couples are able to save / invest more money because of two incomes and shared expenses, thus generating larger capital gains. Perhaps married couples are much more likely to have children and thus need stable careers and incomes to pay for their children. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other 4 features  are not suprisingly in the top 5, and I had guessed them correctly in Question 6. These aren't surprising because they are the most directly relevant to income. Other features like \"sex\", \"race\", \"relationship\", \"work-class\" have a vague, and likely minor, effect on income level. I was considering adding \"native-country\" to my top-5 list, as developed countries like the US are much more likely to have incomes > 50k, but that didn't seem to play as important effect. \n",

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "The F-score and accuracy for the optimized model trained on reduced features performs slightly worse than the training on the full feature set (still better than the unoptimized model). As mentioned above, because the optimized model has n_estimators = 500, training time takes significantly longer than the default RandomForestClassifier where n_estimator = 10. There is a small tradeoff whether or not to reduce the number of features. One the one hand, the training time drops, but on the other hand, f-score drops by 2.5%. In conclusion, dropping the features would be something to consider and discuss with the customer. "
